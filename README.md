# WebGM

WebGM is an attempt to gather together tools and random generators for the purposes of:
 1) Emulating a Game Master for solo play of "tabletop" RPGs
 2) Creative inspiration, particularly for writing or storytelling
 3) Procedural generation of content ideas, particularly for games.
 
While there are other attempts to create such a tool abailable on the internet, to my knowledge none are open-source, and most are maintained by a single coder. WebGM attempts to rectify this problem, allowing as many people as are interested to contribute to the development of the project, as well as allowing free use for all. It is hoped that this will result in a higher-quality program incorporating the best of what the solo rpg-playing community is capable of.
 
All content produced by the generators and/or tools of WebGM is available for any and all use, including commercially and without attribution. The source code of WebGM is available under the GNU General Public License, version 3. Of course, the creators would enjoy knowing about anything you create with the help of WebGM.

All content within WebGM (that is to say, the random generators, the lists used for those generators, and the game mechanics implied by the structure of the tool) is used in accordance with any licenses concerning it, or has been changed to the extent where it would be considered a transformative work under the laws of fair use.
